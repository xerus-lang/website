# `.cnut` file format

Squirrel source code is saved in `.nut` files. These are saved as squirrel bytecode (compiled nut) in `.cnut` files.

Given a completely empty squirrel source file, `blank.nut`, you can compile it with:

    $ sq -c -o blank.cnut blank.nut

...and if you dump it using `xxd`, you get the following:

    $ xxd -g1 blank.cnut

The `.cnut` file begins with a bytecode stream tag:

    fa fa - SQ_BYTECODE_STREAM_TAG

This is followed by a serialized closure object:

    52 49 51 53 - SQ_CLOSURESTREAM_HEAD - 'RIQS' - 'SQIR' backwards, because little-endian.
    01 00 00 00 - sizeof(SQChar)
    08 00 00 00 - sizeof(SQInteger) - 64-bit integers
    04 00 00 00 - sizeof(SQFloat) - 32-bit (single-precision) floats
    [Function Proto]
    LIAT

Every squirrel program has an implicit `main` function, and all of the other functions are nested within this.

## Function Proto

A function proto is a sequence of parts, each prefixed with 'TRAP' - 'PART' backwards.

The first part contains the source file name and the function name:

    54 52 41 50 - TRAP (PART backwards)

    10 00 00 08 - type = OT_STRING
    09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - length = 9
    62 6c 61 6e 6b 2e 6e 75 74 - 'blank.nut' (no NUL)

    10 00 00 08 - type = OT_STRING
    04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - length = 4
    6d 61 69 6e - 'main'

The next part denotes the counts of items in the next parts:

    54 52 41 50 - TRAP (PART backwards)
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - nliterals
    02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - nparameters
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - noutervalues
    02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - nlocalvarinfos
    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - nlineinfos
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - ndefaultparams
    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - ninstructions
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - nfunctions

Then there are parts for the literals, parameters, etc.

    [Literals; there are none]
    [Parameters; there are 2...]
    10 00 00 08 - OT_STRING
    04 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - len = 4
    74 68 69 73 - 'this'

    10 00 00 08 - OT_STRING
    05 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - len = 5
    76 61 72 67 76 - 'vargv'

    [Outers; there are none]
    [Local Var Infos; there are 2]

Local var infos:

    - name, pos, start_op, end_op -- don't know what they're used for.

    [Line Infos; there is 1]

    - line, op -- this maps a particular op offset to the original line of source.

    [Default Params; there are none]
    [Instructions; there is 1]

    00000000 17 ff 00 00 - {arg1: 0x00000000, op: 0x17, arg0: 0xff, arg2: 0x00, arg3: 0x00}

This is `_OP_RETURN`.

    [Functions; there are none]

    02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - stack size
    00 - bgenerator
    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 - varparams

## Comparison with Lua

The bytecode format is spookily similar to Lua's, including the order of the parts.

Squirrel literals are referred to as constants in Lua.
Squirrel outers are Lua upvalues.
